# 2IMA15CG

Repository for participating in [the Fourth Computational Geometry Challenge, as part of CG Week in 
Berlin, Germany, June 6-10, 2022](https://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/competition/cg-shop-2022/), as part 
of the 2IMA15 Geometric Algorithm course.

The problem is solving the Minimum Partition into Plane Subgraphs: partitioning a graph into a minimum number of planar subgraphs. A related problem (partitioning into a minimum number of plane spanning trees) is tackled in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05440.pdf.

## How to build

`mkdir build`
